# Lua-Project-Tycoon


-Description: 
One of my older but most completed project using lua. Much of the game was coded by myself, aside from a few other assets created by other team helpers. This game was a "Tycoon" game where the goal was to make money and "upgrade" your buisness to unlock everything. The result of this project was instantly shown with a massive success rate in obtaining over 1 millions plays and 100 concurrent players at its peak in a 3 month span. Game analytics was used to tweak certain aspects of the game to improve playability which resulted in an exponontial-like growth of game popularity.

- Random Crate Drop System:
Coded a randomized crate drop system where an object (crates in this instance) would be placed in random locations through out a map. If a user touches it then it would give that user a random amount of money. Used functions, storage, and a few variables to complete this in a more effecient way.

- MarketPlace GUI and System
Created a purchase GUI where there would be many clickable buttons, all being able to purchase different amounts of in-game currency. The system was created in a relatively easier way of code by using the "Marketplace Services", which is part of the API exlusive to the Engine.
